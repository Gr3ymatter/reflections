How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I could easily see new lines and removed lines.
Helpful when i want to find a typo, they are shown next to eachother

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If i mess up, i dont have to spend hours searching for a change.
I can go back to the previous working version in seconds. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: 
Complete control of when the commits happen. Not too small to clutter my log
Cons:
Can be too big or too small.
Can forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Large programs can have changes that span multiple files. 
If only one file was tracked, we would miss changes in other files. Errors would be hard to catch.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git Log: Shows all the different commits. Helps narrow down which snapshot to view
Git Diff: The difference between two different snapshots.
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can test soemthing out without having to worry about commenting things out
If things dont workout then i can always go back to my previous version.
I used to do that with the arduino version...should use version control more often.
